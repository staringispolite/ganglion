### /ˈɡaNGɡlēən/ (noun)

The [cochlear ganglion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_ganglion) is the group of nerve cells that serve the sense of hearing by sending a representation of sound from the cochlea to the brain.

Ganglion is a Python script that processes audio time signatures output by Cochlea (comma separated millisecond values), and parses that along with video input, to output a video with cuts that fit the beat time signature.
